# tkpoint
Trackpoint configuration frontend for linux

I wrote this initially in bash/zenity and then rewrote it in python/tkinter so I could have real-time adjustment of settings, I am putting both out there for people to use or improve upon cause I have basically lost interest in further hacking on it. 

If you'd like to use or improve this or even use the rather simple approach as a template for other such tools, feel free to do so.
